It is possible to deploy a new instance of the sample apps built in Slash GraphQL. This will spin a fresh backend with a new instance of the sample app hosted and schema generated for you.

In order to do a `One-Click Deploy`, please choose the application you wish to deploy from the [Apps](https://slash.dgraph.io/_/one-click) tab in the side bar and click the `Deploy` button.

It will take few minutes while the new back-end spins up. You would be able to see the front-end url under `Details` card on the [Dashboard](https://slash.dgraph.io/_/dashboard) tab in the sidebar.
